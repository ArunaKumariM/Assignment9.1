#2. Suppose p the proportion of students who are admitted to the graduate school
#   of the University of California at Berkeley, and suppose that a public relation
#   officer boasts that UCB has historically had a 40% acceptance rate for its graduate
#   school. Consider the data stored in the table UCBAdmissions from 1973. Ässuming
#   these observations constituted a simple random sample, are they consistent with the
#   officerâ..s claim, or do they provide evidence that the acceptance
#   rate was significantly less than 40%?
#   Use an It 0.01 significance level


# Hypothesis
# H0 : p = 0.4 and 
# H1 : p < 0.4.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
